🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fabcode-it-solutions/HelloMeet.git
cd HelloMeet

2️⃣ Install dependencies
npm install

3️⃣ Setup environment variables

Create a .env.local file:

NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_URL=your_livekit_server_url
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

You’ll need a LiveKit server (self-hosted or LiveKit Cloud).

4️⃣ Run the development server
npm run dev

Visit:

http://localhost:3000

🔐 Token API

The app uses a /api/token endpoint to generate room tokens securely using your LiveKit API credentials.

This ensures:

Users can only join valid rooms

Credentials are never exposed to the client
